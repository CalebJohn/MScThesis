  \begin{thesisabstract}  
    Modern homeless shelters are collecting data from key interactions with clients. This data can be utilized by machine learning algorithms to identify clients that are at risk for chronic homelessness. This would provide shelter operators with a powerful new tool to assist them in housing individuals. However, most machine learning algorithms are not suitable for the task due to the lack of interpretability. Classification rule learning is brought forward in this work as an exceedingly interpretable class of machine learning algorithms.
A novel recommender system based on classification rule learning is proposed and evaluated on local homeless shelter data. The results from this work suggest that classification rule learning is robust and interpretable enough to be used to support modern homeless shelters.
		% A novel system based on classification rule learning was proposed and evaluated on local homeless shelter data. These results suggest that classification rule learning is robust enough to be considered for use in modern homeless shelters.

	First of all, I'd like to thank my supervisor Geoffrey Messier, without his input and support this would not have been possible.
	Next I'd like to thank my teammates who have been excellent companions through the different stages of this degree; Ayush, Santosh, Rajith, and Sujoy.
	I'd also like to thank my family, who have supported me throughout all my years of schooling.
	And finally, thanks to my loving wife Rachel, who has listened to me soundboard ideas more than a sane person should have to.
